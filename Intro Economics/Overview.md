# Introduction

Disclaimer: All my notes definitely contain mistakes (namely typos). Of course, conceptual errors are much more egregious but I have not spotted any thus far; 
take all information on the notes with a grain of salt. Furthermore, I might have missed out some content especially in macroeconomics (what comes to mind is broad vs thin money).

My notes are obviously not very concise. However, they also contan more information than needed and also sometimes are more technical than required. I have appended all unnecessary content in the appendix. 
They are included because they often can come up if you choose to do essays. For example, the proof of the existence of a utility function can set you apart should you choose to write an essay about utility functions (because you know the conditions under which we can represent utility). 
I have tried to prove any result in my notes, especially for microeconomics. Some results, particularly those in probability and statistics (notably the law of iterated expectations in full generality) are beyond my reach. Some are also excluded because they are beyond the scope of the course, such as microfounding the savings rate in the Solow-Swan model. 

These (sometimes sketchy) proofs are not required, though I think they might be useful (for intuition)! For instance, in the 2024 Prelims Microeconomics paper, it would be useful to have in your artillery the proper proof for why the reservation price of a demand curve with constant PED is infinite. 

Other than that, do consult the slides first and foremost, as well as any useful textbooks:
1. For microeconomics, I found Varian's intermediate microeconomics with calculus to be very useful. Complement this with the slides particularly on applied topics such as Oligpoly, Monopoly (and price discrimination) where Varian's treatement is relatively inadequate. 
I heavily disliked Perloff's textbook's style because I found it unreadable.
2. For macroeconomics, the slides are most useful. For (occassionally) more in depth discussion, use the Jones' textbook. His discussion on the short run (particularly IS-MP-PC) was superior to the slides.
Where treatements are terrible, one should consult more advanced texts.
