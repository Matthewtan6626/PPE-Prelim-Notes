# Introduction

For Prelims, I prepared two topics for General Philosophy, and 3 topics for Moral Philosophy (2 deep, 1 not so deep). I prepared every topic for logic except with identity. 

This just depends on your risk apetitite but my senior recommended to study the number of questions you are going to do in the exam for that particular section + 1 more. So, because I intended to only do 1 question in the general philosophy segment, I only prepared two topics. 

I uploaded the notes for the topics which I prepared for General Philosophy: (1) Knowledge, (2) Free Will; and Moral Philosophy: (1) Objections, (2) Justice, (3) Act vs Rule Utilitarianism. 
The reason why I choose (3) for moral was simply because it was integral to the other 2 topics I studied. 

## A note on logic

I think, as many people do, it is optimal to do two questions in logic. This is because logic is highly improvable and is not difficult. There are almost always only one question with identity, one question (wholly) dedicated to natural deduction and counter-examples in predicate logic, one question dedicated to formalisation in predicate logic, one question dedicated to set theory. Unfortunately, almost all these expectations were thwarted in my year. 

The best resource for getting used to natural deduction is: [https://users.ox.ac.uk/~logicman/carr/NDpack.pdf] or the Natural Deduction pack. I think it is quite useful as a break of sorts.
