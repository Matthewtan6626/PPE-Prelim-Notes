# Introduction

For Prelims, I prepared two topics for General Philosophy, and 3 topics for Moral Philosophy (2 deep, 1 not so deep). I prepared every topic for logic except with identity. 

This just depends on your risk apetitite but my senior recommended to study the number of questions you are going to do in the exam for that particular section + 1 more. So, because I intended to only do 1 question in the general philosophy segment, I only prepared two topics. 

I uploaded the notes for the topics which I prepared for General Philosophy: (1) Knowledge, (2) Free Will; and Moral Philosophy: (1) Objections, (2) Justice, (3) Act vs Rule Utilitarianism. 
The reason why I choose (3) for moral was simply because it was integral to the other 2 topics I studied.
